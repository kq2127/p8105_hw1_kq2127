```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1
```{r df_create and means}
p1_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(8),
  gr_th_0 = sample > 0, 
  vec_char = c("My", "complete", "full", "name", "is", "Jane", "Reed", "Doe"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("Red", "Red", "Green", "Green", "Green", "Blue", "Blue", "Blue"))
)


mean(pull(p1_df, sample))

mean(pull(p1_df, gr_th_0))

mean(pull(p1_df, vec_char))

mean(pull(p1_df, vec_factor))
```

When I take the mean of the first two variables in my data frame I get a result. The mean of sample is 0.4999535, and the mean of variable gr_th_0 is 0.625. I was not able to take the mean of the last two variables, vec_char and vec_factor because these two variables are not numeric or logical. 

```{r converting variables, eval = FALSE}

```
